specification: |
  Indicates the confidence level in the association assertion.
  Uses an integer scale from 0 to 5:
  
  0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
  1 = Questionable reliability of evidence  
  2 = Secondary evidence, data probably reliable
  3 = Direct source, primary evidence, data considered reliable
  4 = Well-supported conclusion from primary evidence
  5 = Very high confidence
  
  This scale matches the confidence model used in the GEDCOM Evidence
  extension for consistency across extensions.

  - 5: Business partnership documented in legal records
  - 3: Godparent relationship from church baptism record
